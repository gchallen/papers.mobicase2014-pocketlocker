PocketLocker addresses an emerging need of mobile systems by crafting a
personal storage cloud from multiple personal devices.  It targets storing
rarely changing files. An intelligent orchestrator arranges storage to
maximize usage of devices of different sizes and minimize network costs.
PocketLocker is free and uses no additional devices. System storage and
backup policies are based upon data gleaned from an extended testing using
100 smartphones.
