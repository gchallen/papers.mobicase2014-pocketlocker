\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec-conclusion}

PocketLocker addresses an emerging need of mobile systems by crafting a
personal storage cloud from multiple personal devices.  It targets storing
rarely changing files. An intelligent orchestrator arranges storage to maximize
usage of devices of different sizes and minimize network costs.  PocketLocker
is free and uses no additional devices. System storage and backup policies are
based upon data gleaned from an extended testing using 100 smartphones.

Looking ahead, we envision incorporating energy minimization in the system's
chunk placement algorithm---presently, it considers network connectivity and
storage size.  The timing of when new files are uploaded to the PSC presently
hinges on fixed deadlines.  We would like to use a more flexible schedule that
considers network and energy conditions dynamically.

We are grateful to the support staff of the \PhoneLab{} team at the University
at Buffalo for assisting us with deploying the platform changes needed to
collect detailed file usage information. \PhoneLab{} administrator Maulik Dave
was particularly helpful in setting up our experiments and providing
information about the testbed.
