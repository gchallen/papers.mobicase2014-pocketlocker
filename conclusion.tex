\section{Future Work and Conclusion}
\label{sec-conclusion}

PocketLocker addresses an emerging need of mobile systems by crafting a
personal storage cloud from multiple personal devices.  It targets storing
rarely changing files.  An intelligent Orchestrator
arranges storage to maximize usage of devices of different sizes and
minimize network costs.  PocketLocker is free and uses no additional devices.
System storage and backup policies are based upon data gleaned from an
extended testing using 100 smartphones.

We would like to incorporate energy minimization
in the system's chunk placement algorithm---presently, it only considers
network connectivity and storage size.  The timing of when new files are
uploaded to the PSC presently hinges on hardcoded deadlines.  We would like to
use a more flexible schedule that considers network and energy conditions
dynamically.
