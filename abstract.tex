PocketLocker creates scalable, reliable, and performant personal storage
clouds out of available space distributed across multiple personal devices.
Designed to store rarely-changed files on both interactive devices with
limited storage (such as smartphones) and non-interactive devices with large
amounts of storage (such as storage appliances), PocketLocker differs from
previous systems in not requiring that each device be able to store all
available content or be configured to only view certain files. Instead, a
storage orchestrator running as a cloud service distributes erasure-coded
file chunks across all available devices to attempt to maximize performance
and capacity and minimize energy usage at battery-powered clients while
meeting configurable backup requirements. And unlike current cloud storage
options, PocketLocker is free and will scale as users add devices to their
personal cloud.

We motivate PocketLocker's design by analyzing two months of file access
traces taken from 100 smartphones, and evaluate its performance both using
trace-based simulations to explore design parameters and measurements of a
prototype Android implementation to establish real-world performance. By
locating file content close to where it will be accessed by mobile devices,
PocketLocker provides low-latency access to large amounts of content. By
exploiting mobility and user charging habits, PocketLocker can meet backup
requirements without draining the smartphone's battery.
